## Installation 
The user can find the deployed app on [Heroku](link) 

## Usage

When the user starts the application, they are taken to the home page which has three links: sign up, login, and about us. Each link takes the user to the corresponding webpage.

To access the input page, the user must sign up or login with pre-existing credentials. They are then taken to the input page. 

The input page displays the current month, with the option to change the monthly budget. Below the budget, the user can input a date, price, description, merchant, and category. Once this information is filled out, the user can submit the transaction by clicking the submit button. This will add the transaction to a table below and update the large budget number to reflect the value of the recent transaction.
